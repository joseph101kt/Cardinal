# ðŸ“š Cardinal â€“ A Spaced Repetition Flashcard App

**Cardinal** is a flashcard-based study tool designed to help users retain information more effectively through spaced repetition. Users can upload decks in JSON format, review cards one at a time, and optionally make their decks public so others can use them. The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## âœ¨ Distinctiveness and Complexity

Cardinal distinguishes itself from typical CS50W projects in several key ways:

- **Spaced Repetition Logic**  
  The core feature of Cardinal is a custom-built spaced repetition algorithm. Each user's performance on individual cards is tracked via the `UserCardData` model. The model stores review counts, streaks, timestamps, and uses a score-based system to calculate the optimal interval before a card should be reviewed again. This system encourages long-term retention and efficient studying.

- **User-Specific Review Scheduling**  
  The app doesn't just track whether a user got a card right or wrong â€” it adjusts the next appearance of each card dynamically based on their performance history. This logic introduces meaningful complexity in both model design and query handling.

- **Deck Creation via JSON Upload**  
  Instead of using a form to add one card at a time, users can upload a structured JSON file to generate a full deck. This workflow is particularly efficient and scalable for power users or AI-assisted deck generation â€” a distinct approach compared to the manual CRUD operations typically found in other CS50W projects.
